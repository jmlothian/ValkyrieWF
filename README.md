Valkyrie Workflow Engine

This is a simple, yet scalable distributed workflow processing engine written in C# using ZeroMQ (0MQ) as a communication layer.  The original design is several years old predating Windows Workflow Foundation and it included support for .Net 1.1 legacy code.  It is a work in progress updating it to modern code and semantics. 

The primary goal of the implementation is to provide a simple, easy to develop with and debug for system.  For those tired of constantly battling WCF service contracts, this should provide a reasonable alternative.
